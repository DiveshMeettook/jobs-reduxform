# Job offers board

This is a copy of an [original website](https://www.aijobs.tech/fr/). I rebuilt it using React, Redux and Material UI.

The website consists of two routes, one for "Hiring" page ('/hire'), and the other for the "Offers" page ('/'). Because it's a demo, The state is stored locally in reduxStore (changes will be lost after reloading the page).

## Run Project

After cloning, you can run the project by doing:

### `npm i`

then

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
